# clipper-2-prototype
Clipper phase 2 files

Base files required for an installation of clipper in a PHP environment.

The files available within this repository are all the client side elements of the Clipper application. The DBCommunicator javascript
file in this version is configured to request JSON data payloads from PHP files. The PHP files included in the php directory are for 
demo purposes and have been written to query the database structure descibed in clipper-2-structure.sql.

Documentation on how to configure end points will follow soon. Due to the multitude of possible environments we intend to define a 
single config file where base URLs and username/userId referrals can be established.
